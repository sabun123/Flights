# Flights
ReactJS POC Wireframe App

Currently, due to the nature of the data in the Mocky.io link containing mostly
identical data throughout except flight number, the search
field only works for Flight No. If the other data had differences in them,
other searches could have been conducted as well.

Initial Requirements:
1. Have an Internet connection (app needs access to Mocky.io)
2. Install dependencies using
npm i

How to run in Development:
1. npm run dev

How to run in Production:
1. npm run build
2. npm run prod

NOTE: You will only need to do number 1 once, since all we're doing is creating the bundles that ExpressJS will need to serve our App.

Tools used:
1. ReactJS 15
2. Bootstrap 3.3.7
3. Webpack 4
4. ExpressJS
